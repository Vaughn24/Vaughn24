### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

**` Aspiring Data Scientist `**

I am currently a 4th year college undergrad majoring in computer science. I study at Mapua Malayan Colleges Mindanao. Hoping to land a career in data. Working in a team has been a significant part of my experience. I believe I have enough work experience to prove that I am a team player and a good follower. On the other hand, my experience as an active member of the MCM Computing Student Society as Honorary Council and Facilitator, demonstrate that I can also be a good leader. My achievements and accomplishments do not indicate that I am knowledgeable; rather, they represent my commitment to my lifelong learning journey.
